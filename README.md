# SphHarm

Matlab code that plots the 3D diagram of Hydrogen molecular orbitals and its 2D polar plot for selected quantum numbers l,m,n

It uses the spherical harmonics and solves them via Legendre functions. This code was written some time back so there are minor errors, but most of it is annotated.

Feel free to fork the repo and make adjustments by yourself, and also look at the example pdf given.
